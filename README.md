The proposed website is about doing e-commerce business for the sale of handmade goods. It will help handmade importers and small local producers to sell their handmade products, and at the same time, an individual customer will benefit. Also, COVID-19 Pandemic has forced the global shutdown of several activities, including shopping activities. This resulted in making the website for online shopping which is a benefit for both sellers and customers.  

The proposed website will ensure product details and information to its customers, since no one wants to buy something that they do not know enough information about it. The goal of this project is to make sure that the customers have sufficient information about the products when they are doing their shopping, so we are looking forward to making a website that provides online services.
